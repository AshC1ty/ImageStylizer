## The Project
This project is an image stylizer that applies artistic styles to images using a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub. The model transforms input images by applying different artistic styles, creating a visually appealing effect.

## Features
+ Uses a pre-trained deep learning model from TensorFlow Hub
+ Applies artistic styles to input images
+ Simple and efficient implementation

## The theory behind it
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique that applies the artistic style of one image (style image) to another image (content image) while preserving the original content structure. This is achieved using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically leveraging feature extraction from deep layers.
